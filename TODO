O. add multiprocessing.RLock to blacklist database calls
    O. remove database/* locks
O. instead of communicating with messages through a queue,
    just pass self.blacklist & have messages make blacklist calls
O. refactor Reddit instantiation
    O. move to reddit.py (maybe rename redditprefix -> reddit)
    O. refactor bot.py:_handle_rate_limit -> reddit.py
        O. create a generic error handler which calls the pertinent
          error-handler (map APIException handlers by error_type)
        O. need to notify all processes of rate-limit & put all to sleep
    O. instantiate in bot.__init__
    O. instantiate another instance in messages.run_forever
O. add config options:
    O. SEND_DEBUG_PM on/off
        O. refactor into separate class? (in replies.py maybe?)
            -- needs to instantiate its own Reddit instance (to get the
            redditor object)
        ? add more debug pms
4? move messages.py reply methods to replies.py .. maybe
    I don't think anything else should need those specific methods
    (but the same can probably said of the methods in replies.py)
O. mentions parsing
    O. queue.put( thing.submission )
    O. gate by time -- don't parse through the same submission within
        T time
        - but there could be new comments with usable links
        - someone could spam mentions in a single submission
            eg. hitting enter a bunch of times because of lag
        O. maybe keep a database of (username, submission) & only
            queue.put if the specific combination has not been seen
            (prevents the same user summoning multiple times)
5.1? refactor messages, mentions stream parsing to mixin/base class
6. implement bot.subs
    - read subreddits from database / json
    - join subreddits with '+'
    ? update from database whenever the file mtime changes
        (this is required for mentions-added subreddits to work without
         bot restart)
7. instagram stuff
    - fetching & caching (+config option to expire cache)
        - parse data into usable format
        - caching = save data to file .. maybe a database? json?
    - bad links db for temp bans (404s only?)
        => if #bad_links > THRESHOLD: temp ban user!
    - if ig fetch was triggered by mentions (submission_queue)
        and ig fetch was successful (fetch ok or cached)
        then add subreddit to to-add db:
            if subreddit reaches a threshold of successful mention summons
            then add subreddit to subreddit.comment stream parsing (bot.py)
8. refactor logging
    - add pid (+ option to disable)

N. testing!
